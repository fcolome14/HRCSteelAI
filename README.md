# Steel Alloy HRC

Web API that returns a prediction of HRC measure based on a given steel alloy and the templing temperature applied

## Challenge

### Problem Statement

Heat treatment is a complex process that requires precise control over heating temperature, treatment time, and cooling rates, as these factors significantly impact the mechanical and metallurgical properties of metals.

Designing an effective heat treatment cycle involves a deep understanding of a material’s behavior at different temperatures, as each metallic material responds uniquely. While heat treatment literature provides valuable insights, it often lacks comprehensive data for many existing metallic materials, and much of the accumulated knowledge has been obtained empirically through trial and error.

This dataset serves as a foundation for developing machine learning models that can predict heat treatment outcomes, helping to optimize parameters for target hardness and other material properties.

This personal project, which combines cutting-edge AI techniques with metallurgical expertise, aims to accelerate the development of smarter, more efficient heat treatment solutions.
